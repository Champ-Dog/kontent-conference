# Content Modeling

## Agenda Model

*What information is immediately essential to an end-user at a conference?*

Session information is important for users to find the sessions they're attending:
- Room (or URL for online access)
  - Directions
- Speaker
- Time
- Topic

Helpful but less essential:
A venue map may also be helpful to find rooms, amenities, and entrances.
A schedule of the events at that venue for the day, or duration of the conference.


*An agenda has a location, date, and time, but what other content is related to an agenda?*

- Speakers
- Topics/Presentations

*What content is location-specific?*
- Speaker information
- Rooms
- Session
- Venue information
- Schedules
- Potentially sponsors

My plan is that an agenda will be "assembled" by combining all the relevant sessions - this doesn't necessarily need to be it's own Content Item. I believe an agenda is better considered as a presentation concern than a content one. It doesn't need to introduce new information or content, rather it is a convenient representation of related content (e.g., all sessions at a given venue on a given day).

Agendas will need to exist for both regions/venues, and for each day. It is tempting to rely on language selection to determine which agendas to display, but ideally a user should have access to agendas from both region. It may be suitable to use language selection to determine the "default" agenda display, however. This may introduce complexity beyond the scope of the project, and should be considered a "stretch goal."
