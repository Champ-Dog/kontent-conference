# Content Modeling

## Event Model

*How might we model a landing page (like “Home”) or the overall “event wrapper?” Consider...*
*What is the most important information to be presented up-front as an end-user?*

Critical information includes the conference name, topic/industry, locations and date.

*What are the most crucial call-to-action (CTA) elements for the end user? How about the organization hosting the conference?*

The main initial concerns for a user are likely to be learning about the conference, and how to attend. They may desire information about speakers, topics, locations, times, directions, and registration. 
In terms of calls to action, they may be looking for registration (currently not necessary), directions to venues, or how to learn more.

For the organisation hosting the conference, the priorities may include converting users to conference attendees, and driving traffic towards the online presences of themselves, event sponsors, and the venue providers.

*Can these CTAs translate to anything other than buttons on a web page?*

Yes! Users may want directions to a venue, which could be provided with an imbedded map or trip planner.
Learning more could include watching a video, or following a link to another page/similar.
If registration were to become required, completing a form could be viable - this could still be implemented as an "expression of interest" or "send me more details."
Users could also be encouraged to share information on social media, or follow the accounts of a speaker, sponsor, venue provider, or hosting organisation.

All of these could be implemented as a button on a web page, of course, but including other forms of CTA could lead to a more engaging user experience. It is also important to consider users who are accessing content through other channels, such as a voice assistant.

*What content is reusable across the project?*

Certain session information is re-usable, as the content of the presentations will be the same in both venues.
Speaker information such as name and image should also be reusable, as this is likely to appear in schedule/session information as well as speaker information "sections", and may be used in different channels, such as social media.
Branding information such as the name/logo of the event, sponsors, venues and hosting organisation should also be reusable.

CTAs may also be reusable across channels. TO BE COMPLETED

*Will more than one landing page be necessary for this project?*

Not currently. In a "real world" scenario, this may indeed be necessary: we may want to present different content, or a different experience, for users of a digital assistant vs web browser.

Currently the project includes only one delivery channel: a website under development as part of this project. However, content models should be divorced from delivery/front-end concerns as much as possible. If a content item is developed for an entry point ("landing page" is not recommended terminology, as it reflects a specific delivery channel), it should be as channel-agnostic as possible.

Another possible approach would be to implement taxonomies, or multiple models/items, to differentiate between intended channels. While this should be minimised, it may be a useful alternative.

Regardless, when considering the entry point, it will be wise to consider the experiences of different channels, and separate as much as possible the actual content from the presentation.

*How can this “wrapper” be used in non-web-centric implementations?*

This could be used to bundle/wrap related content together for delivery. Putting aside the idea of a website, a landing page is essentially an entry point for a user. The consideration then becomes, what information is critical at an entry point, regardless of presentation? 

It can also be helpful to consider the customer journey at this point. Although this entry point will be accessed by customers at different stages of the journey, it is likely always going to be one of the first interactions a potential customer has.

There is some overlap between the content that is relevant for customers at the beginning of their journey, and that which is relevant at a primary entry point to digital presence of the project. In both cases, branding and key information such as dates and locations should be considered a priority. This will help a new customer form an association with our branding, and quickly understand the where, when, and what of the conference. For customers further along their journey, it gives them quick access to the most critical information of the conference, and also a simple way to know "where they are" - are they accessing the content they're interested in^.

^*As an example of this, imagine a user accessing this content through a digital assistant. Including the name chosen for the conference and the host organisation in the first pieces of content allows the customer to quickly confirm their assistant is providing the correct information: "What conference? I asked about continents!"*

Similarly, thinking about the content that might be needed for the front page/s of a brochure or pamphlet, or a radio segment, can yield similar results: the first things to surface are the name and nature of the event, and critical information. Naturally there are some differences with each of these channels, but my thought process here is that focusing on the commonalities can help identify what the core content is, regardless of presentation.

*Could it work for IoT devices, voice-enabled digital assistants, and chatbots?*

I've largely covered this above. As these questions are mostly to help with thinking and planning, and my responses are largely "thinking out loud," I don't see much value in straining the point.
