# Content Modeling

## Event Model

*How might we model a landing page (like “Home”) or the overall “event wrapper?” Consider...*
*What is the most important information to be presented up-front as an end-user?*

Critical information includes the conference name, topic/industry, locations and date.

*What are the most crucial call-to-action (CTA) elements for the end user? How about the organization hosting the conference?*

The main initial concerns for a user are likely to be learning about the conference, and how to attend. They may desire information about speakers, topics, locations, times, directions, and registration. 
In terms of calls to action, they may be looking for registration (currently not necessary), directions to venues, or how to learn more.

For the organisation hosting the conference, the priorities may include converting users to conference attendees, and driving traffic towards the online presences of themselves, event sponsors, and the venue providers.

*Can these CTAs translate to anything other than buttons on a web page?*

Yes! Users may want directions to a venue, which could be provided with an imbedded map or trip planner.
Learning more could include watching a video, or following a link to another page/similar.
If registration were to become required, completing a form could be viable - this could still be implemented as an "expression of interest" or "send me more details."
Users could also be encouraged to share information on social media, or follow the accounts of a speaker, sponsor, venue provider, or hosting organisation.

All of these could be implemented as a button on a web page, of course, but including other forms of CTA could lead to a more engaging user experience. It is also important to consider users who are accessing content through other channels, such as a voice assistant.

*What content is reusable across the project?*
Certain session information is re-usable, as the content of the presentations will be the same in both venues.
Speaker information such as name and image should also be reusable, as this is likely to appear in schedule/session information as well as speaker information "sections", and may be used in different channels, such as social media.
Branding information such as the name/logo of the event, sponsors, venues and hosting organisation should also be reusable.

CTAs may also be reusable across channels. TO BE COMPLETED

*Will more than one landing page be necessary for this project?*

*How can this “wrapper” be used in non-web-centric implementations?*

*Could it work for IoT devices, voice-enabled digital assistants, and chatbots?*
